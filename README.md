## Problem Statement/ motivation:
Lockdown phase has transformed almost everything into work from home which has been a huge challenge for everyone right from the students, teachers, and universities to developers, companies and what not? Be it collaborating for projects, interview process which is considered to be efficient if conducted one to one or be it the teaching learning process. It feels like a revolution of our century. Amidst all of the problems and challenges every individual is trying to figure the level best solution at an individual level. So Codepair.io is just an attempt from our side to solve this problem.
Introduction:
Codepair.io is a platform that is inspired by the simplicity of google docs with the real intention of solving the problem of remote collaboration.
So here we introduce CodePair.io, which solves this problem easily and effectively. It not only provides additional features but also ensures with its UI, UX that users will find it very handy and easy to use tool.
How does it work?
Initially, a user is required to sign up and then login with his credentials in order to use platform. Once logged in the user is redirected to his own dashboard where he/she can see the details of the various room the user has been a part of. The user has a choice here of going back to on of the existing rooms or creating a new room. If the user chooses to continue with any of his/her existing rooms, then he/she is redirected to the page of that room where the previously made notes and the content can be checked. In the other case the user is given an option to create a new room by simply entering the Room Name. Once that is done the user can see the room page. The user can now share the room link with his/her colleagues and can start collaborating. The user also has the option to make and edit notes to note down the important points during the discussion. The syncing of the editors across users takes place using a Web-RTC library called Puser.js which broadcasts the content in real-time.
